# Day 10 - Symmetric encryption & decryption and Asymmetric encryption & decryption

In this part, we will learn about doing encryption and decryption using cryto module of node.js symmetrically as well as asymmetrically.

## Topics Covered:

> To run scripts: \$ node <file-name.js>

1. [Encryption and decryption]()

2. [Types of encryption]()

3. [Symmetric or private key encryption]()

4. [Asymmetric or public key encryption]()

## Summary

In this chapter of 30 days of node tutorial series, we learned about how we can use `crypto` module in node.js for encryption and decryption. We learned about what is encryption , what is decryption , why encryption is necessary , how we can perform symmetric or private key encryption and decryption. Also we learned about public key or asymmetric encryption and decryption.
