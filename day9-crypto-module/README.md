# Day 9 - Crypto module (Hashing & HMAC)

`crypto` module in node.js is used to provide cryptographic functionalities.It includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash , HMAC , verify , cipher , decipher and sign functions. In part-1 , we'll learn all about hash and hmac functions.

## Topics Covered:

> To run scripts: \$ node <file-name.js>

2. [Hashing Examples]()

3. [Hashing a file]()

4. [Hashing Problems]()

5. [HMAC]()

6. [HMAC Examples]()

7. [HMAC file]()

## Summary

In this chapter of 30 days of node tutorial series, we learned about how we can use `crypto` module in node.js for hash and HMAC operations. We learned about the snippets of SHA512 , ripemd160 , SHA256 , SHA384 , SHA224 , SHA1 , md5 , whirlpool cryptographic hashing algorithms. Also, we learned about hashing a file using node.js `crypto` module.
