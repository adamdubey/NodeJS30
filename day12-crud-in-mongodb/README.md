# Day 12 - CRUD operations in MongoDB

Classified as a No SQL database , MongoDB is a scalable, open source, high performance , document-oriented database designed by keeping developers agility in mind. It is document-oriented which means that it does not store data in tables and rows as we would in relational databases like MySQL, In this we store data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema.

**Advantages:**

- **Dynamic schema:** If we have an flexible schema then it is ideal for JSON-like documents as in MongoDB however it is difficult to implement it in a good manner in Relational databases.

- **Scalability:** MongoDB is highly scalable

- **Cheap:** Can be downloaded free of cost.
