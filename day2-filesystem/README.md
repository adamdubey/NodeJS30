# Day 2 - File System

Node.js gives the functionality of File I/O by providing wrappers around the standard POSIX functions. In Node.js, File I/O methods can be performed in both synchronous as well as asynchronous form depending upon the user requirements.

## Topics covered:

> To run scripts: $ node <file-name.js>

1. [Read a File]()

2. [Write a File]()

3. [Append a File]()

4. [Rename a File]()

5. [Delete a File]()

  - `fs.readFileSync()` : Read file in synchronous way.
- Write file operation using nodejs
  - `fs.writeFile()` : Write file in asynchronous way.
  - `fs.writeFileSync()` : Write file in synchronous way.
- Append file operation using nodejs
  - `fs.appendFile()` : Append file in asynchronous way.
  - `fs.appendFileSync()` : Append file in synchronous way.
- Rename file operation using nodejs
  - `fs.rename()` : Rename file name in asynchronous way.
