# Day 20 - Timers in node.js

Node.js Timer modules exposes a global API which is used to schedule functions to be called later at some given time. Node.js timer is a construct which is used to calls a particular function after a given time. Also when the function is called depends upon which timer function is associated with it while creating it and also what work node.js event loop is doing. We don't need to explicitly call `timers` function because of their global access.

## Topics Covered:
